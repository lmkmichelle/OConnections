  Our project is a text-based spinoff implementation of the famous New York Times' game Connections,
  a game where there is a 4x4 grid of words, and the words are each grouped into 4 random 
  categories that the player must figure out. Unlike the New York Times' game, though,
  O-Connections includes custom modes of varying difficulties, and unique hints to aid 
  players through all-purple modes!
